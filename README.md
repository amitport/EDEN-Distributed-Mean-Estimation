# EDEN: Communication-Efficient and Robust Distributed Mean Estimation for Federated Learning

This repository is the official implementation of 'EDEN: Communication-Efficient and Robust Distributed Mean Estimation for Federated Learning'.


## Context

*EDEN* is a lossy unbiased compression technique for distributed mean estimation that handles heterogeneous communication budgets and packet losses naturally and simply.

## Folder structure 

The `torch` and `tf` folders contain EDEN's implementation in PyTorch and Tensorflow, respectively.
